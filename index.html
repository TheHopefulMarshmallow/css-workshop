  <p> Hi my name is Anthony Fulginiti and I am the most techonologically inept student in this class. I will have to be good at project management and communication if I am to ever be successful in the industry because my inability to quickly learn and properly use technology and applications is disgusting. Hopefully my classmates will carry me in this regard. If anyone who wanted to hire me saw my first source tree repository they would probably laugh in my face and ask what is wrong with me</p>
